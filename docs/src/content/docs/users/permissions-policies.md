## **Managing Permissions**

### **Steps to View or Modify Permissions:**

1. Navigate to **Settings > User Groups & Permissions > Manage Permissions**.
2. Select the resource type you want to manage.
3. Assign actions (List, Create, Read, Update, Delete) based on user, group, or everyone levels.
4. Save changes to apply the updated permissions.

### **Best Practices:**

- **Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to each user or group.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review permissions to ensure they align with organizational needs.

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Multi-User Wallet Management**

- **Group:** Assign "Read" and "Transfer" permissions to the Finance Group for account resources.
- **Specific User:** Grant "Update" permission to the Compliance Officer.
- **Everyone:** Restrict access to "List" for account resources.

### **Scenario 2: External Canister Funding**

- **Group:** Assign "Fund" permissions to the Operations Group.
- **Specific User:** Allow "Read" access for monitoring purposes to a specific developer.
- **Everyone:** Deny public access to external canister management.

## **Understanding Approval Policies**

Approval policies are sets of rules that determine how transactions and actions within an Account are approved before execution. These policies can be predefined for convenience or defined manually on a per-action basis.

### **Benefits of Predefined Approval Policies:**

- **Consistency:** Apply the same set of rules across different actions.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Update rules in one place and apply changes system-wide.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Quickly assign pre-configured rules to new approval policies.

## **Policy Rules**

Approval policies can be based on the following rule types:

- **Auto-Approved:** Requests are automatically approved without any user action.
- **Quorum Percentage:** Approval is granted when a specified percentage of approvers have approved the request.
- **Quorum:** Approval requires a defined minimum number of approvers.
- **All Of:** Every assigned approver must approve the request.
- **Any Of:** Approval is granted when any one of the assigned approvers approves the request.
- **None Of:** The request is automatically rejected, preventing execution.

## **Creating or Modifying Approval Policies**

### **Steps:**

1. Navigate to **Settings > Request Policies**.
2. Select the action for which you want to configure a policy.
3. Choose a predefined policy or assign the rule type (auto-approved, quorum, etc.) manually.
4. Configure any additional parameters, such as quorum size or percentage.
5. Save the policy to activate it.

## **Best Practices for Approval Policies**

- **Use Predefined policies for Consistency:** Define approval rules for common approval scenarios to reduce errors.
- **Leverage Quorum for High-Value Transactions:** Require multiple approvers for sensitive operations.
- **Avoid Over-Complexity:** Keep policies straightforward to avoid delays in approvals.
