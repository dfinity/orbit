## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust Toolchain**: Install from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- **DFX**: Install the DFINITY Canister SDK by following the [Internet Computer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove/).
- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **pnpm**: Install globally using npm:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

---

## Step 1: Clone the Orbit Repository

Start by cloning the Orbit repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/orbit.git
cd orbit
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Use `pnpm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

## Step 3: Set Up the Development Environment

Run the helper script provided by Orbit to configure the development environment:

```bash
./orbit
```

This script initializes the necessary settings for your environment.

## Step 4: Start the Local Development Server

1. Start the Internet Computer replica in the background:

   ```bash
   dfx start --clean --pocketic --host 127.0.0.1:4943
   ```

2. Deploy the canisters to the local replica:

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

3. Navigate to the wallet application directory:

   ```bash
   cd apps/wallet
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Orbit wallet interface.

## Step 5: Explore the Codebase

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the Orbit project structure:

- **Core Logic**: Located in the `core` directory.
- **Wallet Frontend**: Found in the `apps/wallet` directory.
- **Shared Libraries**: Available in the `libs` directory.
